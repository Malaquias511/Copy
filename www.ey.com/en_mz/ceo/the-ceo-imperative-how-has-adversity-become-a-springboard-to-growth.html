   <p><span class="selection-dropcap">B</span>efore the pandemic, many companies delayed responding decisively to new value drivers and imperatives. That’s no longer an option. The COVID-19 pandemic hastened the full-force arrival of trends already on the CEO agenda. The stakes are now existential: the latest global EY CEO Imperative survey shows the pandemic has accelerated the trajectory of organizations, and CEOs must seize this opportunity to transform and leap ahead or risk being left behind.</p> 
   <p>That’s because companies are quickly being divided into what we call “thrivers” and “survivors.” Thrivers are leaning into this pivotal moment, and outdistancing survivors in growth.</p> 
   <p>So, how do you become a thriver or get even stronger? The EY CEO Imperative Series is designed to provide critical answers and actions to reframe the future of your organization, with the CEO Imperative Study, a survey of 305 chief executives of Forbes Global 2000 companies, focused on insights to achieve sustainable growth in the long term. We believe a new DNA for successful enterprises is emerging, built around human-centered transformations that break down silos, increase agility, improve innovation, and drive toward long-term value.</p>

          <p><em>Our CEO Imperative and Capital Confidence Barometer studies look at now, next, and beyond the pandemic to how leaders can reframe the future of their organizations.</em></p> 
          <p>Where was your company when COVID-19 struck? It’s tempting to assume strategy, in the broadest sense, mattered little in the past 12 months. After all, extraordinarily well-run organizations overnight found markets had disappeared, while a rising tide in other sectors lifted all boats. Yet our research into how companies weathered <a href="../strategy-transactions/we-are-in-same-storm-but-are-we-all-in-same-boat.html">the short-term impact of the pandemic, are now navigating the medium-term, and where that leaves them in the long-term</a> reveals a universal truth: leadership matters.</p> 
          <p>This CEO Imperative study finds the performance of companies is highly correlated with their trajectory before the pandemic. Thrivers (34% of organizations surveyed) were growing before the crisis and are leaning into this pivotal moment, accelerating their existing transformation agenda. Survivors (32%) were already experiencing declining revenue, will keep seeing flat or declining growth over the next three years, and are slowing their transformation priorities. Between them are maintainers (34%), which are companies more likely to have had low or flat growth before the pandemic and whose growth will remain flat or grow moderately over the next three years.</p> 
          <p>Does that mean companies are trapped on their current trajectory? No. But for survivors to narrow the gap to thrivers, CEOs must urgently accelerate their transformation efforts. <a href="../strategy/the-ceo-imperative-is-your-strategy-set-for-take-off.html">The CEO cut of our latest EY Global Capital Confidence Barometer</a> provides a window into that effort. It finds 13% of CEOs – what we call “value visionaries” – have embraced new practices to reframe their enterprises. They view COVID-19 as a wake-up call to fuel their bold growth ambitions, which will yield value for a broader range of stakeholders, not just shareholders. The remaining 87% – “pragmatists” – are leaders who recognize the need to re-orient for a post-pandemic business landscape but have not fully committed to action plans.</p> 
          <p>So, where’s your company? And which kind of CEO are you? Where you are today isn’t necessarily where you’ll be tomorrow. But our research shows the importance of moving from intention to execution, and closing the key capability gaps to acquire the DNA of the future enterprise: one built around human-centered transformations that increase ability and innovation while driving long-term value.<strong></strong></p>

   <h4>Diverging thrivers and survivors<br> </h4> 
   <p>The imperatives of the pandemic accentuated the upward or downward trajectories companies were already on. The paths of thrivers and survivors are set to diverge even further: 79% of thrivers are projecting growth in three years; only 7% of survivors are.</p>

   <p>Over half (58%) of thrivers accelerated their existing transformation in response to the pandemic, likely benefiting from the right strategy going into the pandemic, less disruption and easier access to capital. As a result, thrivers are already pursuing a growth agenda. Thrivers were growing before the pandemic and will continue growing steadily.<br> </p> 
   <p>In contrast, most survivors (54%) slowed their existing transformation priorities and are focused on cost reduction. Where thrivers are moving quickly ahead, survivors are still retooling.</p>

   <h4>CEOs are ready to pivot to new risk-taking and growth</h4> 
   <p>Looking across the broader study population, it’s evident CEOs are ready to pivot from stabilization to new investments in growth and transformation:</p> 
   <ul> 
    <li>61% plan to undertake a major new transformation initiative</li> 
    <li>68% plan a major investment in data and technology</li> 
   </ul> 
   <p>CEOs also plan to spend more on transformation over the next three years. These investments are not going to be offset by cost reductions for the most part, with nearly half citing investor support to invest in these initiatives even if near-term financial performance is diminished.<br> </p> 
   <h4>Newly urgent trends drive transformation<br> </h4> 
   <p>The trends driving company transformation are not new, but they are newly urgent. The market shear caused by the pandemic, as business shifted to digital and virtual and consumer preferences shifted abruptly, underscores the peril of delaying action on long-standing trends and the benefits of a proactive strategy.</p>

   <p>Delaying a decisive response to new value drivers and imperatives is no longer an option. Thriving companies are outpacing surviving ones in growth and transformation, and CEOs must rise to this moment to avoid falling behind. CEOs are ready to reframe their enterprise but need to bridge key capability gaps. To thrive, organizations must acquire a new DNA by putting humans at the center of decision-making, adopting technology at speed, and driving innovation at scale. Weaving these value drivers into every aspect of transformation will allow CEOs to drive long-term value creation and ultimately maximize growth potential.</p>
